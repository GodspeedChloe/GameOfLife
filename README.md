Implementation of Conway's game using MIPS R2K

To find a MIPS R2K simulator, I recommend using SPIM: http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/
Or if you have access, CS @ RIT has a great simulator RSIM: https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csci250/documents/rsim.html

Make sure you make the program and run the ".out" file when running the simulation.

Acceptable arguments for the program!

Board size 4 <= n <= 30

Number of generations: 0 <= n <= 20

Number of living cells: 0 <= n <= size * size

Cell locations: anywhere in a n x n grid. (0,0) is in top left, and cells are (row,col).
